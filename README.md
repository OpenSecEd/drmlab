drmlab
===============================================================================

This is a lab assignment I developed for a course on Computer Security during 
spring 2014.  The main aim is for the student to reflect on the principles and 
requirements for trusted computing.

`make drm.pdf` will generate the PDF containing the instruction.  The directory 
`cpager-drm` contains the source code for the small program with a trivial DRM.
`make -C cpager-drm` will build the executable.
